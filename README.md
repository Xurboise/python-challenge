# python-challenge
We have the two folders, one for PyBank and PyPoll, with the their own subfolders(Resources and analysis) and their own "main" python file.
For each of the "analysis" folders, the main.py file of their respective folder, when ran, will generate an "analysis.txt" for each PyBank and PyPoll.
